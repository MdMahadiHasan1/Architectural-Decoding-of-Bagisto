## Quality Attribute

Bagisto supports multiple online selling scenarios including B2C("Business to Consumer"), B2B("business-to-business"), and multi-vendor marketplaces. Understanding the quality attributes—non-functional requirements that define system effectiveness beyond functional capabilities—is essential for evaluating Bagisto’s architectural strengths. 
Of course. Here’s a refined version of **Quality Attributes** for Bagisto, reflecting their connection to stakeholders and retaining a software document style with depth and completeness:

---

## Quality Attributes (with Stakeholder Connection)

1. *Functional Suitability:* Functional suitability measures how well a system’s features satisfy both user and business needs; for instance, when a retailer (Business Owners/Shareholders, System Integrators) must launch a multivendor marketplace within days, Bagisto’s modular “Seller” package (enabled via Laravel service providers and migrations) provides out-of-the-box vendor registration, product management, commission rules, and extensive configuration options. This directly serves **Business Owners, Sellers, Customers, Product Managers, and System Integrators** by minimizing custom code and speeding up delivery, while retaining flexibility for future customizations by **Open-Source Contributors**.

2. *Performance Efficiency:* Performance efficiency concerns resource utilization under heavy load; during a flash sale with 5,000 concurrent users (Customers, Sellers), Bagisto utilizes Redis/Memcached for route, config, and view caching, employing Laravel queues to defer heavy workloads (email delivery, invoice processing) and employing Vue.js SPA components to reduce full-page reloads. This guarantees sub-100ms response latency for **Customers**, maintains platform stability for **Business Owners**, and helps **DevOps Engineers** manage workloads gracefully, while delivering a smooth experience for **Product Managers** and retaining loyalty from **Suppliers and Partners**.

3. *Reliability (Availability & Fault Tolerance):* Reliability refers to the platform’s ability to remain operational under stress; if an EC2 node fails at peak, Bagisto’s architecture, deployed through AWS with ELB/ALB, autscales to handle additional load (with containers and orchestration) while Laravel Horizon gracefully handles failed jobs through a retry mechanisms. This guarantees high service stability for **Business Owners, Customers, Sellers, and System Integrators**, strengthening their confidence in the platform, and honoring service level agreements with **Technology Providers**.

4. *Scalability:* Scalability assesses whether the platform can grow alongside its stakeholders’ demands; as the number of **Business Owners’ stores**, **Suppliers’ products**, and **Customers’ orders** increases, Bagisto can scale its stateless application nodes horizontally (Docker, ECS, or Kubernetes) while adding database read replicas and employing CDNs for static content delivery. This approach directly serves **Business Owners, Sellers, Product Managers, and System Integrators** by removing bottlenecks and preserving a smooth customer experience under heavy load.

5. *Security:* Security safeguards against unauthorized access and data breaches; Bagisto utilizes Laravel’s parameter binding, CSRF and XSS protection, password hashing, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained authorization. All sensitive transactions are secured over TLS, payments are routed through PCI-compliance gateways, and data export and deletion mechanisms enable GDPR compliance. This collectively protects **Customers’ data, Employees’ operations, Payment Gateways’ financial transactions, and prevents attacks by Cybercriminals and Privacy Activists** — all while retaining the confidence of **Business Owners**, **Suppliers**, **Technology Providers**, and **Regulatory Bodies**.

### Security
 
Security is a top priority for any E-Commerce platform, and Bagisto is no exception. Since it handles sensitive customer data such as personal details, payment information, and order history it’s vital to implement robust security measures at every level. Below is an overview of key security practices to protect your Bagisto-based shopping website.

1. *User Authentication and Authorization:* A secure user authentication system is vital in preventing unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive areas of the website. Implementing strong password policies (e.g., requiring a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) helps to strengthen account security. Additionally, the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) can provide an extra layer of protection. Users should also be encouraged to use unique passwords for their accounts. For administrators, restricting access to the backend based on roles and permissions can limit the impact of a potential breach.
For example, Bagisto can offer a role-based access control (RBAC) system, where different levels of access are granted to admins, store managers, and customers. This way, sensitive operations (such as deleting products or managing customer data) are protected from unauthorized users.

2. *Data Security:* Data security is paramount for any e-commerce site, especially when it comes to sensitive customer information, including names, addresses, payment details, and order history. Encryption plays a vital role in securing this data both at rest and in transit. Bagisto allows for encryption of customer data during transactions, and developers and also ensured that the database is appropriately secured by using hashed passwords and secure database access controls. Another critical aspect of data security is regular backups. Implementing an automated backup strategy ensures that even if the website faces a security breach or data loss event, it can quickly recover and restore data to its last known good state.

3. *Secure Payment Gateway Integration:* When dealing with payment processing, security is of utmost importance. Bagisto allows integration with popular payment gateways such as PayPal, and Cash on delivery all of which have strong security protocols like tokenization and encryption. When integrating these payment processors, it’s essential to ensure the website is PCI DSS compliant. This compliance ensures that all customer payment details are handled securely and in accordance with industry standards. 

4. *Threat Monitoring:* To prevent security risks, threat monitoring is essential. Bagisto administrators implemented the Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network activity and flag suspicious behavior like brute-force attacks or unauthorized access. Utilized Laravel’s built-in logging system helps track system events and errors, which are regularly reviewed. Setting up automated alerts for critical incidents ensures quick response. Additionally, conducting regular security audits, including penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability assessments, helps identify and fix potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers, maintaining a strong and secure system.

5. *Personal Data Protection:* Bagisto stored sensitive details such as customer names, addresses, emails, and payment info only as long as needed for business purposes and ensured secure deletion afterward. Users have access to tools that let them update, delete, or export their data easily. A clear privacy policy mainly outlined what data is collected, how it's used, how long it's retained, and offered users the option to opt out or withdraw consent.

6. *SSL Encryption for Secure Communication:* One of the most basic yet crucial security measures is the implementation of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL ensured that all data transmitted between the user’s browser and the website’s server is encrypted, making it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept or manipulate sensitive information. This is especially important during checkout when users enter payment details or personal information. 

7. *Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans:* Even with the best security measures in place, websites are still susceptible to threats like data corruption, server failure, or hacking attempts. Bagisto website administrators implemented a robust backup system that ensured the data can be restored in case of an emergency. Regular backups  scheduled, and the backup files stored securely. 

8. *User Session Management:* User sessions are another area where security must be closely monitored. Bagisto have user session management system and it’s essential to implemented session timeouts and ensured that expired sessions are properly terminated. Additionally, session tokens securely stored, and websites enforce to secured cookie practices (such as using the HttpOnly and Secure flags) to prevent session hijacking.

9. *Transparency:* Lastly, transparency plays a vital role in the overall security and trustworthiness of the Bagisto shopping website. Users always be informed of any data breaches or vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise their information. An effective way to ensured that this is through a clear security policy and a notification system that alerts customers about any incidents involving their data. Additionally, security badges and certificates (such as SSL and PCI compliance) prominently displayed on the website to reassure customers that the site is safe and compliant with industry standards for handling payment information.

In conclusion, ensuring a secure Bagisto shopping website involves a combination of best practices in encryption, user authentication, input validation, secure payment integration, and ongoing security monitoring. By following these security guidelines, we can safeguard both our users’ data and our website from a wide range of potential threats.

For Bagisto, scalability is not only about handling higher traffic but also about maintaining optimal performance and availability as the business grows. This section explores how scalability is incorporated into the architecture of Bagisto, detailing its design principles, strategies, and the trade-offs involved in ensuring that the platform can grow with the business.Bagisto’s architecture is designed to be highly scalable, addressing both horizontal and vertical scaling needs. Whether deployed for a small boutique e-commerce site or a large, enterprise-level marketplace, Bagisto’s core components support efficient scaling through modular design, caching, load balancing, and robust database handling. Understanding scalability in the context of Bagisto involves analyzing its architecture, database management, caching mechanisms, queue systems, and cloud deployment strategies.

1. Horizontal and Vertical Scalability
- *Horizontal scaling:*
Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers or instances to distribute the workload evenly across the system. Bagisto supports horizontal scaling by allowing the system to run on multiple web servers, which can handle increased traffic. This is achieved through containerization (using Docker), load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities available on cloud platforms. Bagisto's stateless design makes it easy to scale horizontally. Each request is independent, meaning one server can handle a request without relying on others, and additional servers can be added without disrupting the service. By deploying Docker containers or using cloud services like AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Google Cloud’s Load Balancer, Bagisto ensures that web traffic is distributed across multiple servers. These instances can be scaled up or down automatically based on the traffic, which is particularly useful during high-demand events like sales or promotions.

- *Vertical Scaling:*
Vertical scaling involves upgrading the hardware of a single server, such as increasing CPU, memory, or storage capacity. For resource-intensive operations like database queries, complex searches, or data processing, Bagisto can be vertically scaled. While vertical scaling is typically limited by hardware constraints, it remains an option for specific use cases, such as dedicated database servers or processing nodes.In environments where vertical scaling is necessary, Bagisto can optimize its resource consumption by optimizing database queries and using memory-efficient technologies such as Redis for caching and Laravel Octane to serve applications faster. However, vertical scaling alone is not a long-term solution to growing traffic, and horizontal scaling should generally be prioritized for continued growth.


2. Database Scalability

As an e-commerce platform, Bagisto’s database is crucial for storing large amounts of dynamic data such as product catalogs, customer profiles, and transactional data. Ensuring that the database can handle increasing traffic and growing data without performance degradation is key to maintaining a responsive user experience.
   
- *Read Replicas and Sharding:*
Bagisto utilizes read replicas for database scalability. With read replicas, multiple copies of the database are created, and read requests (e.g., for viewing product information or checking order statuses) are distributed across these replicas, reducing the load on the primary database. This ensures faster read operations, especially during high traffic periods.
Additionally, database sharding can be used to split the database into smaller, more manageable pieces, based on certain criteria such as customer ID or product category. This helps to reduce the load on a single database instance by distributing the data across multiple servers.

- *Caching:*
To further optimize database performance, Bagisto integrates with Redis and Memcached to cache frequently accessed data, such as product details and inventory levels. By reducing the number of database queries required for common requests, caching plays a vital role in reducing latency and improving response times.Database scalability allows Bagisto to handle increasingly large product catalogs, customer data, and order histories without compromising performance.


3. Caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

- **Caching:**
  Bagisto implements multiple layers of caching to enhance performance:
  - **Route Caching:** Routes in the application are cached, reducing the time required to determine how a request is handled.
  - **Config and View Caching:** Bagisto caches configuration files and views to avoid repeated loading during each request.
  - **Database Query Caching** Using Redis or Memcached, Bagisto caches the results of frequently accessed database queries, reducing database load and ensuring faster responses.
 
    
- *CDNs for Static Assets:*
Bagisto integrates with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to serve static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. CDNs distribute static content across multiple geographically distributed servers, enabling faster delivery to users worldwide. This reduces latency and load times, improving the overall performance of the platform.

4. Asynchronous Processing and Queues
   
E-commerce websites like Bagisto often need to process tasks that can be time-consuming, such as sending order confirmation emails, processing payments, and generating invoices. Performing these tasks asynchronously helps to keep the application responsive, especially under heavy loads.

- *Laravel Queues:*
Bagisto leverages Laravel Queues to handle time-consuming tasks in the background. By queuing tasks such as order processing or email notifications, Bagisto ensures that users are not kept waiting for lengthy operations to complete. These background tasks are processed asynchronously, freeing up resources for real-time interactions.Bagisto supports multiple queue backends, such as Redis, Beanstalkd, or Amazon SQS, allowing the system to scale the background processing capacity as needed. For example, during peak shopping periods, Bagisto can add more queue workers to process background jobs faster, ensuring the platform remains responsive.

5. Cloud-Based Scalability
  
The modern e-commerce platforms require high availability and the ability to scale quickly, cloud-based scalability is a fundamental component of Bagisto’s architecture. By using cloud services, Bagisto can easily scale its infrastructure without being limited by physical hardware.

- *Cloud Services for Scalability:*
Bagisto is designed to run efficiently on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. These platforms provide essential tools for scalable infrastructure, including load balancing, auto-scaling, and elastic storage. Cloud-based auto-scaling ensures that resources are provisioned dynamically based on traffic, ensuring that the platform can handle surges in demand without manual intervention.
Cloud hosting also provides features like global data replication, which can distribute data across multiple regions, ensuring that Bagisto remains available even in case of regional outages. Additionally, cloud platforms provide managed services like RDS (Relational Database Service) for databases and ElastiCache for in-memory caching, which simplifies database scaling and caching management

- *Load Balancers:*
Using cloud load balancers, Bagisto can distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. The load balancer directs incoming traffic to the healthiest available server instance, ensuring that no single server is overloaded.

6. Scalability Trade-Offs
   
While scalability is a crucial aspect of Bagisto’s architecture, there are inherent trade-offs that need to be considered:

-	*Complexity:* Horizontal scaling introduces complexity in terms of infrastructure management, network configuration, and maintaining data consistency across multiple instances. This requires expertise in cloud services, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and monitoring solutions.
-	*Costs:* As Bagisto scales horizontally by adding more servers or using managed cloud services, the operational costs increase. Businesses need to balance the need for scalability with the associated costs of cloud resources, storage, and network bandwidth.
- *Data Consistency:* In horizontally scaled systems, maintaining data consistency can be challenging, especially with distributed databases or microservices. Solutions like event sourcing and event-driven architectures may help address this, but they introduce additional complexity.
- *Latency:* As more components are added to the system, there is a possibility of increased network latency. For example, requests routed across multiple services or regions may take longer to process, and strategies such as caching and replication become essential to mitigate this.

In conclusion,Scalability is a cornerstone of Bagisto's architecture, ensuring that the platform can efficiently handle growing traffic, large product catalogs, and increasing transaction volumes. By employing a combination of horizontal scaling, cloud-based deployment, database optimization, caching, and queue systems, Bagisto provides a robust solution capable of supporting businesses of all sizes. While scaling introduces complexity and cost challenges, Bagisto’s flexible architecture allows businesses to scale incrementally as needed, maintaining high performance and availability throughout.

As e-commerce demands continue to grow, Bagisto's scalable architecture ensures that the platform is equipped to meet these challenges head-on, offering businesses the ability to scale without compromising on performance or user experience.

### Logical Viewpoint
The Bagisto shopping site can be organized using a layered architecture, which is a common way to build complex software systems. In this setup, the system is divided into different layers, and each layer has its own specific job. As you go from the bottom layers to the top ones, the tasks become more focused and affect fewer parts of the system if something goes wrong. This layered design makes the system easier to build, update, and manage. It also helps the site stay flexible, grow smoothly, and work reliably—important features for a modern e-commerce platform like Bagisto.

| Logical Viewpoint | Description |
|----------------|----------|
| **Edge Layers**  | The Edge Layers serves as the secure entry point for external clients such as web browsers and mobile applications. It acts as a protective boundary between the outside world and the internal system, ensuring that any user interaction begins in a controlled and secure manner. This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests, applying CSRF protection, and managing route filters. By performing these tasks, the Edge Layer ensures that only valid and safe requests reach the inner parts of the Bagisto shopping site, effectively safeguarding the system against unauthorized access and potential security threats. |
| **Presentation Layer**  | The Presentation Layer serves as the interface between users and the Bagisto e-commerce system, handling all aspects of user interaction for both the customer-facing storefront and the administrative backend. This layer is responsible for delivering a seamless user experience by rendering dynamic web pages through Blade templates (for server-side rendering) and interactive components built with Vue.js (for client-side interactivity). Laravel controllers within this layer process incoming HTTP requests, manage session data, and route user actions to the appropriate services in the Product Layer. By decoupling the UI from business logic, the Presentation Layer ensures flexibility—allowing themes to be customized without affecting core functionality—while efficiently directing requests to downstream layers for processing. It also enforces security measures, such as CSRF protection and input validation, before forwarding data to the application’s business logic. |
| **Product Layer**    | The Product Layer plays a crucial role in containing the core e-commerce features and domain-specific logic within an e-commerce platform like Bagisto. It includes essential components such as the product catalog, cart management, checkout flow, and discount modules, which are fundamental to the shopping experience. The purpose of this layer is to implement specific shopping features that are tailored to meet the unique use cases of Bagisto, ensuring that customers can browse products, manage their carts, complete purchases, and benefit from any available discounts seamlessly. |
| **Business Layer** | The Business Layer serves a critical function by housing generic, reusable services and logic that span across multiple features of the application. This layer includes essential services like authentication, user roles, order processing, and payment integration, which are vital for the smooth operation of the business but are not specific to any one feature. The primary purpose of this layer is to ensure that these services, though not tied to a particular function, are available across the system, helping to maintain a consistent and efficient business flow throughout the application.|
| **Infrastructure Layer** | The Infrastructure Layer is responsible for supporting the underlying system needs, ensuring the smooth operation of the entire application. This layer includes crucial services like the Laravel framework, databases such as MySQL, caching systems like Redis, as well as services for handling emails and managing queues. Its primary purpose is to guarantee the scalability, reliability, and performance of the system by providing the necessary infrastructure to handle data storage, communication, and other core system functions. By doing so, the Infrastructure Layer ensures that the application can efficiently manage growing demands and maintain stability. |
| **Integration Layer** | The Integration Layer is designed to handle communication with external services, ensuring that the application can seamlessly interact with third-party systems. This layer includes integrations with various services like shipping providers (e.g., DHL), payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), and SMS/email providers. Its primary purpose is to isolate the logic for interacting with these external services, making the integrations more maintainable and easier to replace if necessary. By separating these external dependencies, the Integration Layer helps to keep the application modular and adaptable to changes in third-party services. |
| **Application Layer** | The Application Layer is responsible for coordinating workflows and use cases across multiple modules within the system. For example, when a user places an order, the application layer handles the process from the cart, through shipping, payment, and finally to order confirmation. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear separation between the domain logic (which focuses on the core business rules) and the orchestration of tasks within complex workflows. By doing so, the Application Layer helps manage the flow of operations efficiently, ensuring that each step in a process is executed in the correct order while maintaining clean and understandable code structure. |

</div>



In conclusion, the logical viewpoint provides a clear and structured representation of the software system's layered architecture, highlighting how different components interact and contribute to overall functionality. By organizing the system into distinct layers—such as Infrastructure, Business, Product, Presentation, and Edge—it ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Additional supporting layers like Application and Integration further enhance the system’s flexibility and robustness, enabling seamless integration, secure operations, and efficient data management.


### Process Viewpoint

  <p>Figure 08: Process Diagram for Bagisto System </p>
</div>


### User Interaction with Storefront 
  - **Browse products**: The process begins with the user accessing the "Web/App/Storefront" to look through available products.  
  - **Add to cart**: Once the user selects products they want to purchase, they add these items to their shopping cart.  
  - **View cart**: The user can review the items in their cart.  
    - **Condition**: If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to log in ([Log in required]).  
    - **Alternative path**: If not logged in, they are presented with an option to log in.  

### Checkout and Order Creation
   **Proceed to checkout**: After logging in (if required), the user moves forward with the checkout process.  
- **Web/App/Storefront**: Sends the order details to the **Bagisto Server**.  
- **Bagisto Server**:  
  - **Create order**: Generates a new order record.  
  - **Reduce stock**: Immediately reduces the stock levels of the products in the order.  
    - **Condition**: This step depends on payment confirmation ([Needs payment]).  

### Payment Processing
  **Bagisto Server**: If payment is required, it sends the order details to the **Payment Gateway**.  
  - **Payment Gateway**: Processes the payment. 
  - **If payment is successful**:  
    - Sends a payment confirmation back to the **Bagisto Server**.  
    - **Bagisto Server**:  
      - Marks the order as paid.  
      - Sends an invoice to the customer.  
      - Generates an order confirmation.  
  - **If payment fails**:  
    - Payment Gateway sends a payment failure message to the **Bagisto Server**.  
    - **Bagisto Server**: Handles the payment failure (e.g., notify the customer, attempt retry).  

### Order Fulfillment
 **Bagisto Server**: Once the order is marked as paid (or in cases where no payment is required, after order processing), it initiates order fulfillment.  
  - **Prepare shipment**: Arranges for the products to be packaged and readied for shipping.  
  - **Process shipment**: Coordinates with shipping carriers (e.g., print shipping labels, schedule pick-ups).  
  - **Shipment notification**: Sends a notification to the **Shopper/User/Customer** with shipment details.  

### Special Scenarios
 **No payment required**:  
  - **Bagisto Server**: Processes the order directly, generates an order confirmation, and sends:  
    - An order confirmation email to the customer.  
    - An order notification to the **Store Administrator**.
- **Order unavailable**:  
  - **Bagisto Server**: Notifies the customer about the unavailability of the order.  
- **Order cancellation**:  
  - **Shopper/User/Customer**: Requests to cancel the order.  
  - **Bagisto Server**: Processes the cancellation and sends a cancellation confirmation to the customer.
 


### Implementation View

The **Implementation View** (or Development View) of the **Bagisto** framework illustrates its **modular architecture, code organization, dependencies, and deployment structure**. Bagisto, built on **Laravel**, follows a **package-driven design**, where core e-commerce functionalities are separated into reusable modules while leveraging Laravel’s foundational components.

#### Key Layers of Bagisto’s Implementation  

1. **Bagisto Core Modules**  
   - **Core**: Base services, helpers, models, and repositories.  
   - **Admin**: Backend dashboard for managing orders, products, and customers.  
   - **Shop**: Frontend logic for product display, cart, and checkout.  
   - **Custom Modules**: Extensions like CMS, marketing tools, or ERP integrations.  

2. **Laravel Foundation**  
   - **Eloquent ORM(Object-Relational Mapping)**: Database abstraction layer.  
   - **Routing**: HTTP request handling (web/admin/API routes).  
   - **Middleware**: Authentication, logging, and security layers.  

3. **Themes & UI**  
   - **Velocity (Default Theme)**: Blade templates, CSS/JS assets.  
   - **Localization**: Multi-language support.  

4. **External Dependencies**  
   - **Composer**: PHP package manager (e.g., Stripe, PayPal integrations).  
   - **NPM(Node Package Manager)**: Frontend asset compilation (Bootstrap, Vue.js).  
   - **Databases**: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis (caching), Elasticsearch (search).
   - **Vendor**: Third-party providers supplying reusable packages, ERP/CMS integrations, and frontend/backend tools (via Composer, NPM, or direct integration).

#### **Why This Matters**  
- **Modularity**: Plug-and-play modules (e.g., add GraphQL API via `Webkul\GraphQL`).  
- **Scalability**: Decoupled components allow horizontal scaling (e.g., separate Redis for sessions).  
- **Extensibility**: Custom themes or modules integrate seamlessly.

  <p>Figure 10: Implementation View </p>
</div>




The Implementation View demonstrates Bagisto’s modular, layered architecture built atop Laravel. It clearly separates concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers while integrating essential third-party tools. This structure aligns with best practices in modern PHP/Laravel-based application development and ensures extensibility and ease of maintenance.

### Deployment Viewpoint

The Deployment Viewpoint illustrates how Bagisto's software components are physically deployed across infrastructure nodes. This view helps stakeholders understand runtime environments, server responsibilities, communication channels, and scalability implications.

Bagisto adopts a modular monolith architecture by default, which is well-suited for small to medium-sized deployments due to its simplicity and ease of management. However, for enterprise-grade needs, it can be restructured into a microservices architecture, offering better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability across distributed systems.

Therefore, this section covers both deployment scenarios:

- A Modular Monolith Deployment, reflecting Bagisto’s default structure.
- A Microservices-Based Deployment, showcasing how Bagisto can be re-architected to support large-scale, cloud-native operations.

#### Deployment View of Bagisto's Modular Monolith
This is Bagisto's default architecture, characterized by a single, unified codebase that contains all functionalities, but is organized into distinct, self-contained modules. This approach simplifies deployment and management, making it well-suited for small to medium-sized businesses. In this scenario, all software components typically run on a single server or a small cluster of servers, with communication happening internally within the application. The image might depict a single server hosting the entire Bagisto application, connecting to a database.

  <p>Figure 11: Deployment View of Bagisto's  Modular Monolith </p>
</div>

#### Deployment View of Bagisto's Microservices Architecture


Bagisto employs a microservices deployment model to enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Each functional module is encapsulated within its own service, allowing independent deployment and scaling.

### Nodes and Components

### 1. Computer

* **Web Browser**

  * Component: `Ecommerce Client Module`
  * Artifacts: `Styles`, `Scripts`
  * Communicates with the API Server via REST API.

### 2. Smartphone

  <p>Figure 12: Deployment View of Bagisto's Microservices Architecture </p>
</div>

The Bagisto Microservices-Based Deployment Viewpoint illustrates a distributed architecture where independent services communicate over REST APIs to fulfill business functions. Each domain-specific service—such as Product Catalog, Invoicing, Payment Gateway, and Shipping—is deployed on its dedicated server, enabling independent development, scaling, and deployment. The API Gateway Service centrally manages client requests from both web and mobile applications, routing them to appropriate microservices. This design supports high availability, modularity, and better fault isolation, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise applications seeking flexibility, horizontal scaling, and cloud-native infrastructure readiness.



# Database Development

Bagisto Database Schema illustrates a modular, normalized, and extensible relational design, well aligned with modern e-commerce requirements. Each functional area (identity, catalog, sales, cart, promotions, feedback) is clearly demarcated yet interconnected via foreign-key relationships. Such a schema supports maintainability, future extension (e.g., chat-bot logs, analytics tables), and robust performance tuning (indexes, sharding, caching). This database foundation enables Bagisto to scale from small shops to large multi-vendor marketplaces without requiring major schema overhauls.

# Architecture Patterns

Bagisto’s architecture Pattern blends the simplicity of a modular Laravel monolith with modern, cloud‑native and microservice‑ready patterns: at its core, it uses MVC and package-based modularization alongside the Repository pattern and Redis caching for clear separations of concern and high performance; Elasticsearch integration offloads intensive catalog searches; a versioned REST API secured by RBAC exposes functionality to front‑ends and third‑party integrations; event‑driven, asynchronous workflows decouple side‑effects like email, inventory updates, and analytics; and containerization plus cloud‑native deployment enable consistent, scalable environments—while enterprise customers can further evolve into fully distributed microservices behind load balancers, leverage serverless functions for peripheral tasks, and adopt a service mesh for secure, observable inter‑service communication.

| **Architecture Pattern**                | **Explanation**                                                                                | **Bagisto Application Usage**                                                                                          | **Architecture Trade‑off**                                                                                        | **Design Part in Bagisto**                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Modular Monolith**                    | A monolithic deployment structured as independent modules that communicate through interfaces. | The open‑source version of Bagisto follows a Laravel modular structure using packages (e.g., Cart, Admin, Customer).   | Easier to develop and deploy initially but can become harder to scale and maintain as the system grows.           | `packages/Webkul/*`                                          |
| **Microservices**                       | A method of developing software as a suite of independently deployable services.               | Bagisto’s enterprise deployment uses microservices for modules like Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, etc.           | Improves scalability and fault isolation but increases complexity, deployment overhead, and operational cost.     | Kubernetes Helm charts, /services/\* repos                   |
| **MVC (Model‑View‑Controller)**         | Separates application concerns into data (Model), UI (View), and logic (Controller).           | Bagisto uses Laravel’s built‑in MVC pattern for its core structure, keeping business logic, views, and data distinct.  | Clear separation improves maintainability but can lead to tightly coupled layers if not properly managed.         | `app/Models`, `app/Http/Controllers`, `resources/views`      |
| **Event‑Driven Architecture (EDA)**     | Systems react to events asynchronously, promoting decoupling and scalability.                  | Bagisto uses Laravel Events & Listeners for actions like `OrderPlaced`, `StockUpdated`, which decouple operations.     | Increases system complexity and debugging difficulty due to asynchronous flows and eventual consistency.          | `app/Events`, `app/Listeners`, queue config                  |
| **Containerization**                    | Packaging software and its dependencies into portable, lightweight containers.                 | Docker support enables containerized Bagisto deployments with MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, NGINX, and Laravel.         | Simplifies deployment and environment consistency but adds operational overhead and requires container expertise. | `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`                           |
| **RESTful APIs**                        | Stateless client‑server communication over HTTP using CRUD principles.                         | Bagisto offers RESTful APIs through the `bagisto-api` package for mobile, frontend apps, and third‑party integrations. | Requires strict versioning and documentation; overhead in request/response formatting.                            | `packages/Webkul/API/routes/api.php`                         |
| **Cloud‑Native Deployment**             | Design optimized for cloud environments (e.g., AWS, GCP).                                      | Bagisto supports deployment on AWS, Azure, and others using RDS, S3, CloudFront, etc., for scalability.                | Tightly coupling with cloud services may reduce portability to other environments.                                | Terraform / CloudFormation templates                         |
| **CQRS (Selective)**                    | Separation of read and write concerns to improve performance.                                  | CQRS is selectively applied in analytics and reporting modules to optimize read‑heavy operations.                      | Adds complexity with separate models and data stores, complicating data synchronization and consistency.          | Custom read models under `packages/Webkul/Analytics`         |
| **Repository Pattern**                  | A layer to abstract and encapsulate data access logic.                                         | Bagisto uses repositories (e.g., `ProductRepository`, `OrderRepository`) for data management.                          | Improves decoupling but can add unnecessary abstraction if overused.                                              | `packages/Webkul/*/Repositories`                             |
| **Asynchronous Processing**             | Using background jobs to handle non‑blocking tasks.                                            | Bagisto leverages Laravel Queues (Redis/RabbitMQ) for email sending, stock update, invoice generation, etc.            | Enhances responsiveness but increases operational complexity and debugging challenges for failures.               | `app/Jobs`, `config/queue.php`                               |
| **Caching**                             | Temporarily storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.                             | Redis is used for config cache, session storage, and API performance improvements.                                     | Improves performance but risks stale data and cache‑invalidation complexity.                                      | `config/cache.php`, `app/Providers/CacheServiceProvider.php` |
| **Load Balancing & Horizontal Scaling** | Distributing workload across multiple servers to ensure availability.                          | Bagisto can be horizontally scaled using NGINX or cloud load balancers (AWS ELB) in Kubernetes setups.                 | Requires session consistency strategy (sticky sessions or shared session store).                                  | Kubernetes Service & Ingress YAML                            |
| **Serverless for Peripheral Tasks**     | Running functions in the cloud on demand without managing infrastructure.                      | Optional AWS Lambda or GCP Cloud Functions handle image processing, scheduled jobs, or invoice generation.             | Cold‑start latency and vendor lock‑in can be challenges.                                                          | `serverless.yml` or Lambda function code                     |
| **Service Mesh**                        | Manages secure, observable, and controlled communication between microservices.                | In enterprise microservice deployments, Istio/Linkerd handle service discovery, encryption, retries, and metrics.      | Adds powerful traffic management but increases complexity and resource consumption.                               | Istio/Linkerd manifests in Kubernetes                        |
| **Elasticsearch Integration**           | Search engine for full‑text and faceted search capabilities.                                   | Used for catalog search, indexing of products, and faceted navigation filtering.                                       | Improves search speed but adds operational overhead and eventual consistency concerns.                            | `config/elasticsearch.php`, `packages/Webkul/Search`         |
| **Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)**    | Security mechanism that restricts system access to authorized users.                           | The ACL system in Bagisto enforces role‑based permissions using Laravel gates and policies.                            | Enhances security but complicates authorization logic and management of roles and permissions.                    | `config/acl.php`, `app/Policies`                             |

## Architecture Patterns Decision for Microservice Pattern vs Modular Monolith

Bagisto adopts a Modular Monolith architecture by default, structuring its codebase into distinct Laravel packages that encapsulate specific business functionalities such as Cart, Catalog, and Customer. This approach promotes clear separation of concerns, facilitating independent development and testing of modules while maintaining the simplicity of a single deployable application. The modular design enhances maintainability and scalability within the monolithic structure.

For enterprise-level scalability and flexibility, Bagisto can be adapted to a Microservices architecture. This involves decomposing the monolithic application into independent services—such as Product, Order, and Payment—each responsible for specific business capabilities. These services communicate via APIs and can be deployed and scaled independently, often orchestrated using tools like Docker.

In summary, Bagisto's architecture supports a transition from a modular monolith to microservices, allowing businesses to start with a simpler structure and evolve to a more complex, scalable system as their needs grow.

# Conclusion
In summary, Bagisto exemplifies a well-architected, open-source e-commerce platform that effectively integrates modular design, extensibility, and modern web technologies such as Laravel and Vue.js. Its architectural foundation supports a range of digital commerce models—from B2C and B2B to multi-vendor marketplaces—while catering to diverse stakeholders including end users, administrators, developers, integrators, and business owners. Core strengths include its scalable modular monolith structure, event-driven capabilities, RESTful API integration, containerized deployment, and a flexible package-based system for feature encapsulation.


Despite its strengths, Bagisto faces several architectural and operational challenges. Performance bottlenecks may arise under high transaction volumes due to its monolithic nature. The ecosystem of third-party plugins and extensions remains limited compared to more mature platforms, potentially restricting out-of-the-box integrations. Testing coverage across modules is uneven, which could lead to undetected regressions or quality issues. Furthermore, internationalization support is not fully comprehensive, posing obstacles for seamless global deployments. Upgrade and migration processes can also be complex, especially in environments with extensive customizations or legacy dependencies.

Addressing these limitations through improved testing infrastructure, a broader plugin ecosystem, enhanced i18n support, and clearer migration pathways will be essential for Bagisto to scale effectively and maintain long-term relevance in competitive e-commerce landscapes.
